# Cuticle Capital

A browser-first idle/tycoon game about building a nail salon empire from a debt-heavy bedroom setup to owning a full shop.

## Current Scope
- Core prototype in Godot targeting Web export first.
- Economy loop: perform services -> earn cash slowly -> buy upgrades -> improve throughput and value.
- Progression path: bedroom setup -> rented suite(s) -> owned salon endgame + infinite progression.

## Project Structure
- `project_context.md`: implementation continuity and engineering state.
- `game-concept.md`: game design intent, loop design, balancing goals, and feature ideas.
- `docs/plans/milestone_plan.md`: execution milestones and immediate next steps.
- `godot/`: Godot project files.

## Tooling
- Engine: Godot 4.x
- Target: HTML5/Web first; mobile testing after web loop is stable.

## Quick Start (once Godot project scaffold is added)
1. Install Godot 4.x.
2. Open the `godot/` folder in Godot.
3. Run the main scene.

## Notes
This repo is initialized with planning docs first so we can keep design and implementation synchronized from day one.
