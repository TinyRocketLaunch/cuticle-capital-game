# Game Concept - Cuticle Capital

## Core Fantasy
Build a nail business from nothing: start in a cramped bedroom with student debt, grind through low-ticket services, then grow into a premium salon operation with multiple stations and employees.

## Player Motivation
- Short-term: complete services and afford the next visible upgrade.
- Mid-term: unlock better locations and staff to feel operational growth.
- Long-term: own a salon and optimize an endlessly scaling beauty business.

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. Start/perform manicure services.
2. Wait or interact through simple action timing.
3. Collect payment.
4. Spend on upgrades (speed, quality, capacity, automation).
5. Increase income rate and repeat.

## Progression Arc
- Tier 1: Bedroom startup
  - Debt pressure, low tools, single station.
  - Manual-heavy interaction.
- Tier 2: Small rented suite
  - Cleaner environment, additional station(s), first pedicure service.
  - Early staffing option.
- Tier 3: Larger suite
  - Multiple stations, stronger staff efficiency, bigger customer flow.
- Tier 4: Owned salon (endgame unlock)
  - Full operations layer, brand/reputation systems, infinite progression.

## Economy & Systems Suggestions
- Currencies
  - `Cash`: primary upgrade currency.
  - `Debt`: early negative pressure; payoff milestones grant rewards.
  - `Reputation`: unlocks higher-spend clients and premium services.
- Upgrade Categories
  - Equipment: increases service value and quality.
  - Workflow: reduces service time and downtime.
  - Capacity: more stations, queue size, staff slots.
  - Marketing: boosts customer arrival and high-value client chance.
- Infinite Progression
  - Post-ownership `Prestige`/`Franchise` loop that resets some progression for permanent multipliers.
  - Cosmetic unlocks and themed shop customization for long-term engagement.

## Retention Features (Modern Mobile Style)
- Daily login streak rewards.
- Time-limited events (seasonal polish collection, trend challenges).
- Missions/achievements with milestone bonuses.
- Optional minigames (precision painting, design matching) for burst rewards.

## Difficulty, Challenge, and Reward Philosophy
- Early game should feel slow but fair; each upgrade must be felt.
- Midgame should introduce meaningful choices (automation vs higher ticket services).
- Endgame should favor optimization and strategic investment instead of pure tapping.
- Rewards should be frequent enough to avoid dead time, but large milestones should feel earned.

## Web-First Build Notes
- Prioritize lightweight UI and deterministic simulation for browser performance.
- Use data-driven balance files to speed tuning without heavy scene rewrites.
- Keep input model compatible with both mouse and touch from day one.

## Initial MVP Feature Cut
- Single service type + one minigame-free completion mode.
- Cash + debt economy.
- 5-10 upgrades.
- One location transition (bedroom -> small suite).
- Save/load + autosave.

## Future Expansion Ideas
- VIP clients with unique demands.
- Employee personalities/perks.
- Interior design score that passively boosts reputation.
- Community events/leaderboards once backend exists.
