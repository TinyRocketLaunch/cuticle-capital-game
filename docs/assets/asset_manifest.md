# Asset Manifest

This folder tracks third-party visual/audio assets imported into `godot/assets/`.

## Workflow
1. Prefer `CC0` assets first.
2. If `CC-BY` is used, add explicit attribution entries in `docs/assets/ATTRIBUTION.md`.
3. Store original source URL, license, author, and import date for every pack.
4. Keep raw download archives in `docs/assets/raw/` (optional) and imported runtime files in `godot/assets/`.

## Planned Packs
- UI/icon baseline (CC0)
- Environment/props tileset (CC0)
- Character sprites for customers/staff (CC0 or CC-BY)
- Basic SFX set (CC0)
